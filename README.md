Challenges & Solutions:

Data Cleaning & Preparation: Addressed missing values, inconsistent data types, and formatting issues directly in Power BI.
Schema & Relationships: Established logical data relationships between sales, products, and customer tables for accurate aggregation.
DAX Calculations: Created custom measures and calculated columns for context-based filtering and performance tracking.
Visualization & Insights: Designed dynamic dashboards to highlight key metrics, optimizing decision-making for sales and operational efficiency.
This project enhanced data-driven strategies for tracking retail KPIs, improving store performance insights.
